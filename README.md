## Motivation

**Bikeshare Wizard forecasts bike and dock availability that will benefit thousands of users a day in Boston.** By combining historical trips data and real-time station status data from Boston's Bluebikes bikeshare system, we are applying two DeepAR time series models for our MVP. Currently, users rely on the real-time station status data provided in the Bluebikes app; however, there is no guarantee that that same number of bikes and docks will be available by the time the user arrives at the station. Our MVP provides forecasts in 15-minute increments up to 3 days for each station in the system, which allows users to plan their commutes ahead of time. **Our mission is to make bikeshare more reliable and to ensure that it remains an attractive and climate-friendly form of transportation.**

## Impact

Bikeshare is a popular form of transportation in many cities across the world, so the impact of our MVP is global. According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/shared-mobility/shared-rides/bike-sharing/worldwide), bikeshare revenue will reach $8B in 2022 and the number of users is forecasted to grow to 1B by 2026. By improving the user experience for bikeshare through availability forecasts, bikeshare will be seen as a more reliable form of transportation and the number of users will grow. This is great for the climate since 1 mile biked (instead of driven) reduces CO2 emissions by 1 pound ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-bike-sharing-really-climate-friendly/)).

## User Interviews

To better understand how we can serve potential users, we conducted a series of interviews with current users of bikeshare in Boston and in New York City.
