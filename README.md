Bikeshare Wizard forecasts bike and dock availability for thousands of users a day in Boston. By combining historical trips data and real-time station status data from Boston's Bluebikes bikeshare system, we are applying two DeepAR time series models for our MVP that we intend to launch to users of Boston Bluebikes.
